## Greetings fellas! ðŸ‘‹

âš¡Just a few words about myself:
- In addition to my main job, I am fond of building and configuring test networks of various blockchains - which I devote a lot of free time to.
- The biggest success, in my opinion, I have achieved in the test networks of such projects as: Solana, Casper, Nym, Mina - where I was later invited to the mainnet.
- Right now I'm running a lot of nodes on various testnets. Many of them are in the Cosmos ecosystem. But I could also highlight such projects as Forta, Massa, Minima, Sei - where I am a validator in testnets and I am waiting for the mainnet.


### :fire: My Hardware:
I have two permanent dedicated servers with locations Helsinki and Frankfurt - which I kindly rent on Hetzner.

**AMD Ryzen 5950X (32 CPU, 128 RAM), 2Ã—960 GB SSD NVMe, 1 Gbit/s-Port**

In addition to dedicated servers, I have a lot of vps on Vultr, for some small local nodes.
